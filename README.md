## 📖 Introduction

**Agentic Misalignment** refers to situations where autonomous AI agents—systems with goals, decision-making capabilities, and the ability to take actions—behave in ways that diverge from their intended purpose, designer intentions, or human values.

### What Makes This "Agentic"?

Unlike passive AI models, agents have:
- **🎯 Goal-Directed Behavior**: Actively pursue objectives
- **🔄 Autonomy**: Make decisions without constant human intervention
- **🌍 Environment Interaction**: Take actions that affect the world
- **📈 Learning & Adaptation**: Modify behavior based on feedback
- **🤝 Multi-Agent Dynamics**: Interact with other agents and humans
- **🛠️ Tool Use**: Access and manipulate external tools and APIs

### Why This Matters

- **🔴 Safety-Critical**: Autonomous agents can cause real-world harm
- **📈 Increasing Autonomy**: LLM-based agents are making more consequential decisions
- **🌐 Widespread Deployment**: From chatbots to autonomous vehicles to trading bots
- **🔄 Emergent Behaviors**: Complex interactions lead to unpredictable outcomes
- **⚖️ Accountability Gap**: Harder to attribute responsibility for agent actions
- **🚀 Rapid Capability Growth**: LLM agents are quickly gaining new capabilities

### Scope

This repository focuses specifically on **autonomous agents (especially LLM-powered)** and covers:
- ✅ Goal misalignment and reward hacking in goal-directed agents
- ✅ Deceptive and manipulative behaviors in interactive agents
- ✅ Multi-agent coordination failures and conflicts
- ✅ Specification gaming and instrumental goal pursuit
- ✅ Power-seeking and resource accumulation behaviors
- ✅ Value learning failures in preference-based agents
- ✅ Tool use misalignment and cascading failures
- ✅ Jailbreaks and safety boundary violations

**Out of Scope:**
- ❌ General ML model failures (classification errors, etc.)
- ❌ Static bias in datasets (unless manifested in agent behavior)
- ❌ Non-agentic AI systems without autonomy
- ❌ Passive LLM completion failures (unless in agentic context)
